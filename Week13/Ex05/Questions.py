Question 1: What is the branching factor at depth 0? At depth 1?
    the branching factor is 9

Question 2: What is the maximal depth?
    the maximum depth is 9

Question 3: Will a MIN move attempt to minimize or maximize the utility?
    A MIN move will attempt to minimize the utility (see code

Question 4: Are states after a terminal state explored?
    No, they are not expolored (see python code)

Question 5: Are all possible states explored to a terminal state?
    Yes, in order to find the optimal move, one has to explore all the states

Question 6: Is this a depth-first or breadth-first search? How do you know?
    It is breadth first search, since we are first exploring the successors, before going to the next depth layer
